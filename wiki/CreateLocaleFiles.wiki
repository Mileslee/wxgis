= Introduction =

The 0.3 version of wxGIS introduce new and more simple mecanism of changing application localization (see [Localization] page). This page describe the locale files create process.


= Details =

To create locale files from the begining you need:
  # Download and install poEdit (http://www.poedit.net/download.php)
  # Download sources (http://code.google.com/p/wxgis/source/checkout), there are several tags for diferent versions of wxGIS (see http://wxgis.googlecode.com/svn/tags/)

The next step is creating catalog for each part of wxGIS (recomended).
To do it ypu should ran poEdit and click File->New catalog...

Set your name and email

Set paths. At least you have to add one path to directory in src folder and one to directory in include/wxgis folder (see picture).

Also you can get locale files from other language and copy them to your language folder (for example, from ...wxGIS\loc\ru to ...wxGIS\loc\en).
Than you can set new paths to that files in catalog config for each catalog and rewrite locale strings.
