#summary This page describes translating locale files for wxGIS.
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

The 0.3 version of wxGIS introduce new and more simple mechanism of changing application localization (see [Localization] page). I provide now the empty locale files (ctalogs), so anybody can translate them.

= Details =

From the beginning to create locale files you need:
  # Download and install poEdit (http://www.poedit.net/download.php)
  # Download from download page archive of empty locale project files to translate of special wxGIS version (eg. 0.4)

After downloading empty locale project files, you have to extract them to some folder (preferable your language two letter code, eg. 'ru' or 'en').

You need to create a project in catalogs manager. 
To create translation project push first button in catalog manager and fill dialog.

You should put the path where you extract empty locale project files. Then you push OK button the translation project should be shown all translations and theirs state.

Double clicking of each catalog (transation) will show dialog where you can put translated strings.
